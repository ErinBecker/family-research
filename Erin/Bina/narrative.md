# Erin's family narrative (Maternal)

## [Caroline Tibbetts](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/L4HZ-6BC) (--> Littlefield)
born: March 1837, NH  
married: Nov 12, 1857 to George W. Littlefield (1838 - )  
died:  
burial:  

### Records

* 1850 Census
	There is a Caroline Tibbetts, age 14 living in the household of a John Horn (2nd?, a manufacturer) and Jane Horn along with their two daughters(?) Martha J 
	and Helen M Horn in Somersworth, Strafford, New Hampshire. Also in the household is a Charles H. Shackford (25), who is a physician. Caroline is shown as born in NH. 
	Relationships are not listed in the 1850 Census. Possibly Caroline is a servant or nanny for the two girls, age 6 and 4. Charles is likely a boarder. Note that Caroline
	names a daughter Helen M. Also, son Roland H's middle initial is for Horn!

At the time of the 1880 census, Caroline and George were living with seven of their children - Frank H (21), Helen M (18), Ida O (15), 
Mary A (10), Carrie J (6), Edeth M (4), and Roland H (2). Annie G, who would have been 20 years old, was not listed in their household.
A grandson, two-year old Frank H. Smith, is also part of their household. Helen and Ida are marked as single (not married, widowed, or
divorced). Did Annie marry a Smith and die in childbirth? Where is the father? 

At this time, only Carrie and Edeth were in school.

In 1920, Caroline (Carolina A.) lived with her daughters Mary (L?) Ayers (56) and Anne Hodgdon (51), both widowed at 21 4th Street, Dover, Strafford, New Hampshire. Carolina's age is listed as 85 and 3/4. Census is dated 9-10 January. I'm not sure this is her. Daughters' ages don't match up. This appears to be a different Caroline/a, who was married to a Frederie(?) Tibbetts [1910 census](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MLZX-6PN).
