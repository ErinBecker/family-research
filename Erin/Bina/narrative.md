Julia is the fourth child of Helen and James Gray. She was born October 24th, 1889 in Ledyard, CT. At time of birth, her parents were 29 (James) and 27 (Helen) years old. James was working as a farmer. Recorder appears to have noted doctor's name in the space for mother's occupation. Delivering doctor is something like "Chipman/Chapman & Gray"?

	* [Census page](3-Gray/Julia-Gray-1900-census-original.jpg)

In 1900, Julia lived with her parents and five siblings in Ledyard Town, New London, CT. Helen is marked
as mother of six children, all living. James is still farming, and rents the farm. Julia and all of her 
siblings are at school, except for two year old Fred. Julia can read and write and spent 9 months at 
school in the previous year (at least that's what was reported). 

Of the 1218 residents of Ledyard Town, the vast majority are white (95.3%). Fifty-two (4.3%) are Black. Four are marked as Italian. And one is marked as Indian. Half (25) of the individuals recorded as Black were born in Portugal. Not clear if this is a marker of Afro-Portugese ancestry, or if all Portugese were considered Black. 

The majority of residents of Ledyard Town were born in Connecticut (81.4%). Another 138 (11.3%) were born elsewhere in New England (NY, RI, Mass, NJ, NH, Penn, Maryland, Maine). Nine were born elsewhere in the US (Michigan, Iowa, IL, NC, FL, Alabama, Georgia). Thirty-seven (3.0%) were born in Europe, excluding Portugal (Poland, Bohemia, Sweden, Scotland, England, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Germany). Twenty-five (2.0%) were born in Portugal. Sixteen (1.5%) were born in Canada (14 marked as French Canadian and 2 English Canadian, 2 have their country of origin listed as New Brunswick, so I guess the enumerator didn't know where New Brunswick was).

In 1910, Julia was 20 years old and living with her husband Frederick two doors down from her father,
his new wife Mary, her brothers Charles (17) and Frederick (12), and half-brothers James (6), Calvin (3), and George (2 mo).

born: March 1837, NH  
married: Nov 12, 1857 to George W. Littlefield (1838 - )  
died:  
burial:  

### Records

* 1850 Census
	There is a Caroline Tibbetts, age 14 living in the household of a John Horn (2nd?, a manufacturer) and Jane Horn along with their two daughters(?) Martha J 
	and Helen M Horn in Somersworth, Strafford, New Hampshire. Also in the household is a Charles H. Shackford (25), who is a physician. Caroline is shown as born in NH. 
	Relationships are not listed in the 1850 Census. Possibly Caroline is a servant or nanny for the two girls, age 6 and 4. Charles is likely a boarder. Note that Caroline
	names a daughter Helen M. Also, son Roland H's middle initial is for Horn!

At the time of the 1880 census, Caroline and George were living with seven of their children - Frank H (21), Helen M (18), Ida O (15), 
Mary A (10), Carrie J (6), Edeth M (4), and Roland H (2). Annie G, who would have been 20 years old, was not listed in their household.
A grandson, two-year old Frank H. Smith, is also part of their household. Helen and Ida are marked as single (not married, widowed, or
divorced). Did Annie marry a Smith and die in childbirth? Where is the father? 

At this time, only Carrie and Edeth were in school.

In 1920, Caroline (Carolina A.) lived with her daughters Mary (L?) Ayers (56) and Anne Hodgdon (51), both widowed at 21 4th Street, Dover, Strafford, New Hampshire. Carolina's age is listed as 85 and 3/4. Census is dated 9-10 January. I'm not sure this is her. Daughters' ages don't match up. This appears to be a different Caroline/a, who was married to a Frederie(?) Tibbetts [1910 census](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MLZX-6PN).
